## GNU GCC Toolchain bare-metal (ELF / KERNEL)

Bleeding edge [GNU GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) targeted for bare-metal (ELF / KERNEL) AArch64 systems. built from sources with latest binutils and newlib. These Builds (on master/main branch) are always made from the latest GCC sources rather than stable releases.

This toolchain AArch64 [AArch32 here](https://github.com/theradcolor/arm-eabi.git). Built with Support for Link Time Optimization, -O3, --disable-nls and removed extras that we don't need.

### Getting the toolchain

Clone using git from this repo, As currently we don't have any mirror or a archived release.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/theradcolor/aarch64-elf --depth=1
```

> Note: This is continous updating repository made from the latest GCC sources rather than stable releases, if you want to use stable release of gcc clone the stable-gcc branch of this repository.

For stable gcc
```
$ git clone https://github.com/theradcolor/aarch64-elf -b stable-gcc --depth=1
```

>  Note: Also using depth flag (--depth=1) is recommended as repository size is large and will keep increasing in future updates.

### Building Linux

This toolchain been built with support for suitable with bare-metal development in mind.

Export the `CROSS_COMPILE` in enviroment

```
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=<toolchain-path>/bin/aarch64-elf-
```

Note that additional kernel patches may require for Link Time Optimization.

### Sources

Along with the compiler (GCC) which is built from latest sources, the GNU and other libraries and prerequisite are also been built from latest sources itself.
